MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD)
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD)

if rank == 0: 
    Divide image into segments based on the number of available processes

    for each slave process:
        Assign a segment to the slave (start_row, end_row)
    Compute segment for master process
    Collect results from each worker
    Assemble and save the final image

else:
    Receive segment assignment from the master
    Compute the color of pixel for the assigned segment
    Send computed segment back to the master
